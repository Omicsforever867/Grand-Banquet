## Overview

Grand Banquet (GB) is a next-generation chemometrics framework for classification analysis on data matrix that systematically explores up to **990 unique combinations** (15 preprocessing × 6 feature selection × 11 classifiers) and provides comprehensive performance evaluation with multi-metric ranking.

### Key Features

- **Exhaustive Pipeline Enumeration**: Systematically explores 990 method combinations
- **Multi-Metric Evaluation**: Kappa, MCC, Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity
- **Overfitting Assessment**: Ratio-based evaluation penalises inconsistent models
- **Composite Leaderboard**: Balances predictive performance with generalisation
- **Parallel Processing**: Model-level parallelism for faster training
- **Interactive Visualisations**: HTML leaderboards with sorting and filtering
- **AI-Powered Reports**: LLM-generated narrative summaries

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the application** （"grand_banquet.py" will be published soon）
   ```bash
   python grand_banquet.py
   ```

   > **Tip**: Ensure that `123.png` and `grand_banquet.py` are placed in the same folder. The image `123.png` is inspired by David Hockney's masterpiece *Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)*, paying homage to this iconic work. Much like one standing by a pool, gazing at one's own reflection in the water, we too observe data. However sophisticated our methods may be, it remains akin to viewing the data through rippling waters: a pursuit of truth through the wave of uncertainty.

### Quick Start: Generate 990 Models with One Click

**The fastest way to explore all 990 combinations (15 preprocessing × 6 feature selection × 11 classifiers):**

1. **Load Your Data** (Tab 1: Data Loading)
   - Select your CSV/XLSX file
   - Click "Load and Split Data"

2. **Select All Options** (Tab 5: Results Analysis)
   - Navigate to **"5. Results Analysis"** tab
   - Click the **"Select All Options"** button
   - This automatically selects all 15 preprocessing methods, 6 feature selection algorithms, and 11 classification models
   - Console will show: "All options selected successfully!"

3. **Configure & Run** (Tabs 2-4)
   - **Tab 2**: Click "Run Preprocessing"
   - **Tab 3**: Click "Run Variable Selection"
   - **Tab 4**: Set CV folds and Click "Train Models" (trains all 990 combinations in parallel!)

4. **View Results** (Tab 5)
   - Generate leaderboard and performance reports
   - Review interactive HTML leaderboard with all 990 model rankings
